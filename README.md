# Polaris
Data engineering side project dressed as a stock prediction tool.

Lambda architecture featuring Spark as the main batch processor, Flink as the main stream processor, and Druid to service ad hoc queries on processed data.

### Todo

Stream layer (speed layer)
-> connect twitter to Flink
-> configure data storage layer (Big Data Storage -> Delta Lake) (Data Representation -> Druid)
-> connect storage layers as Flink sink

Batch layer (?)

Display
-> build frontend
